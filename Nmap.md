# *Nmap*

## *Task1: Deploy*

Deploy the attached VM (No answer needed)

## *Task2: Introduction*
What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server? (ports)

How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer? (65535)

[Research] How many of these are considered "well-known"? (These are the "standard" numbers mentioned in the task) (1024)




## *Task3: Nmap Switches*
What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)? (-sS)

Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"? (-sU)

If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use? (-O)

Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch? (-sV)

The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity? (-v)

Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two? (-vv)

What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats? (-oA)

What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format? (-oN)

A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format? (-oG)

How would you activate this setting? (-A)

How would you set the timing template to level 5? (-T5)

How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80? (-p 80)

How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500? ( -p 1000-1500)

How would you tell nmap to scan all ports? (-p-)

How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)? (--script)

How would you activate all of the scripts in the "vuln" category? (--script=vuln)


## *Task4: ScanTypes Overview*
Read the Scan Types Introduction. (No answer needed)


## *Task5: ScanTypes TCP Connect Scans*
Which RFC defines the appropriate behaviour for the TCP protocol? (rfc 793)

If a port is closed, which flag should the server send back to indicate this? (rst)


## *Task6: ScanTypes SYN Scans*
There are two other names for a SYN scan, what are they? (half-open,stealth)

Can Nmap use a SYN scan without Sudo permissions (Y/N)? (n)


## *Task7: ScanTypes UDP Scans*
If a UDP port doesn't respond to an Nmap scan, what will it be marked as? (open|filtered)

When a UDP port is closed, by convention the target should send back a "port unreachable" message. Which protocol would it use to do so? (icmp)


## *Task8: ScanTypes NULL,FIN and XMAS*
Which of the three shown scan types uses the URG flag? (xmas)

Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used? (firewall evasion)

Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port? (Microsoft Windows)


## *Task9: ScanTypes ICMP Network Scanning*
How would you perform a ping sweep on the 172.16.x.x network (Netmask: 255.255.0.0) using Nmap? (CIDR notation) (nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/16)

## *Task10: NSEScripts OverView*
What language are NSE scripts written in? (lua)

Which category of scripts would be a very bad idea to run in a production environment? (intrusive)

## *Task11: NSEScripts Working with the NSE*

What optional argument can the ftp-anon.nse script take? (maxlist)


## *Task12: NSEScripts Searching for Scripts*

What is the filename of the script which determines the underlying OS of the SMB server? (smb-os-discovery.nse)

Read through this script. What does it depend on? (smb-brute)


## *Task13: Firewall Evasion*

Which simple (and frequently relied upon) protocol is often blocked, requiring the use of the -Pn switch? (icmp)

[Research] Which Nmap switch allows you to append an arbitrary length of random data to the end of packets? (--data-length)

## *Task14: Practical*
Does the target (10.10.60.142)respond to ICMP (ping) requests (Y/N)? (n)

Perform an Xmas scan on the first 999 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open or filtered? (999)

There is a reason given for this -- what is it? (no responses)

Perform a TCP SYN scan on the first 5000 ports of the target -- how many ports are shown to be open? (5)


Open Wireshark (see Cryillic's Wireshark Room for instructions) and perform a TCP Connect scan against port 80 on the target, monitoring the results. Make sure you understand what's going on. (No answer needed)

Deploy the ftp-anon script against the box. Can Nmap login successfully to the FTP server on port 21? (Y/N) (Y)


## *Task15: Conclusion*

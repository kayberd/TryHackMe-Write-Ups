Which layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of the Session layer of the OSI model (Full Name)? (APPLICATION)

The Network Interface layer of the TCP/IP model covers the functionality of two layers in the OSI model. These layers are Data Link, and?.. (Full Name)? (PHYSICAL)

Which layer of the TCP/IP model handles the functionality of the OSI network layer? (INTERNET)

What kind of protocol is TCP? (CONNECTION-BASED)

What is SYN short for? (synchronise)

What is the second step of the three way handshake? (SYN/ACK)

What is the short name for the "Acknowledgement" segment in the three-way handshake?(ACK)

## Task5:

What is the protocol specified in the section of the request that's linked to the Application layer of the OSI and TCP/IP Models? (Domain Name System)

Which layer of the OSI model does the section that shows the IP address "172.16.16.77" link to (Name of the layer)? (Network)


In the section of the request that links to the Transport layer of the OSI and TCP/IP models, which protocol is specified? (User Datagram Protocol)

Over what medium has this request been made (linked to the Data Link layer of the OSI model)? (Ethernet II)

Which layer of the OSI model does the section that shows the number of bytes transferred (81) link to? (Physical)

[Research] Can you figure out what kind of address is shown in the layer linked to the Data Link layer of the OSI model? (MAC)

## Task6:

What command would you use to ping the bbc.co.uk website? (ping bbc.co.uk)

What is the IPv4 address? (217.160.0.152)

What switch lets you change the interval of sent ping requests? (-i)

What switch would allow you to restrict requests to IPv4? (-4)

What switch would give you a more verbose output? (-v)

## Task7:
Can you see the path your request has taken? (No answer needed.)

What switch would you use to specify an interface when using Traceroute? (-i)

What switch would you use if you wanted to use TCP SYN requests when tracing the route?(-T)

[Lateral Thinking] Which layer of the TCP/IP model will traceroute run on by default (Windows)? (internet)

## Task8:

What is the registered Tech Email for microsoft.com? (msnhst@microsoft.com)

## Task9:

What is DNS short for? (Domain Name System)

What is the first type of DNS server your computer would query when you search for a domain? (recursive)

What type of DNS server contains records specific to domain extensions (i.e. .com, .co.uk*, etc)*? Use the long version of the name. (top-level domain)

Where is the very first place your computer would look to find the IP address of a domain? (local cache)

[Research] Google runs two public DNS servers. One of them can be queried with the IP 8.8.8.8, what is the IP address of the other one? (8.8.4.4)

If a DNS query has a TTL of 24 hours, what number would the dig query show? (86400)
